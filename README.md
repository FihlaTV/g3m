###The multiplatform advanced visualization framework
###G3M is a **framework** developed and designed to: 

 + Develop **mobile maps** apps in 2D, 2,5D and 3D
 + Work with **real time** data
 + Integrate **any kind of data** (format,size)
 + Be integrated on any legacy system
 + **High performance** mobile native development
 + Multi Touch screens
 + Face the problem of the **mobile performance** as an **integrated** problem between server & client
 + Online - Offline, cache management
 + Real time, push management

Architecture
============ 

The G3M architecture has been created to have a Multiplatform API creating the fewest possible amount of source code.
We have developed a core in C++ that is translated to Java (to work on Android devices) and later is translated to GWT (HTML5 - Javascript)
In every platform there are some libraries that must be developed in the diferent prgramming languages, this classes are declared as abstract and must be developed individually for every platform.
The result is that we have a native API on IOS, Android and webGL and we can  easily add new platforms when it was needed.
